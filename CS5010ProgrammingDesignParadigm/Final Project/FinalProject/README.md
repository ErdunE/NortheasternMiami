## üé¨ Project Overview
The **Entertainment Recommendation System** is a **JavaFX-based** application that provides personalized movie recommendations by interacting with the **TMDB API**. This system allows users to explore movies based on different recommendation strategies, apply filters, and search for specific movies.  
The project evolved significantly from the mid-semester prototype to the final version, integrating more features and implementing robust design patterns to ensure flexibility and maintainability.

## üß© Design Patterns
* **Strategy Design Pattern**
  * Allows dynamic switching between different recommendation strategies.
  * Implemented strategies include:
    * Popular Recommendation
    * Genre-Based Recommendation(![Deprecated](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Deprecated-lightgrey) )
    * Rating-Based Recommendation
* **Factory Design Pattern**
  * Creates recommendation strategies dynamically based on user input.
* **Context Class**
    * Manages different strategies and allows switching strategies during runtime.

---
## üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies

* **Java SDK 23.0.1**: Core Java SDK for running the application.
* **[JavaFX SDK 23.0.1](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/)**: For building the graphical user interface.
* **[JSON Library (json-20240303.jar](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.json/json/20240303)**: For parsing TMDB API responses.

Ensure these dependencies are correctly set up in your project environment.

---

## üåê API Integration

* **TMDB API**  
  The application fetches movie data using The Movie Database (TMDB) API. Ensure you have a valid API key from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).

---

## üì• Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

* **Java Development Kit (JDK) 23.0.1 or higher**
* **JavaFX SDK 23.0.1**
* **Internet Connection** for accessing the TMDB API  

### Steps to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ErdunE/NortheasternMiami.git
   cd NortheasternMiami/CS5010ProgrammingDesignParadigm/Final Project/FinalProject/src

2. **Set Up API Key**

    - Obtain an API key from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).
    - Update `TMDBHttpRequest.java` with your API key:

      ```java
      private static final String API_KEY = "API_KEY";
      ```

3. **Configure Dependencies**

    - Dependencies are in `/src/dependencies/`
    - Ensure `javafx-sdk-23.0.1` is set in your `PATH`.
    - Add `json-20240303.jar` to your project's library path.

4. **Compile the Code**

   ```bash
   javac --module-path /path/to/javafx-sdk-23.0.1/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -d out src/**/*.java

5. **Run the Application**

    ```bash
    java --module-path /path/to/javafx-sdk-23.0.1/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -cp out Main
    ```
## üß™ Testing

### Key Test Cases

1. **`RecommendationContextTest`**
    - Tests dynamic switching of recommendation strategies.
    - Verifies behavior when no strategy is set or a null strategy is provided.

2. **`RecommendationFactoryTest`**
    - Checks the creation of different strategies (`PopularRecommendation`, `RatingBasedRecommendation`).
    - Ensures invalid or null inputs throw appropriate exceptions.

3. **`TMDBServiceTest`**
    - Ensures TMDB API calls return valid movie data.
    - Verifies methods like `fetchPopularMovies`, `fetchMoviesByGenre`, `fetchRatingMovies`, and `searchMovies`.

4. **`PopularRecommendationTest`**
    - Tests fetching popular movie recommendations.
    - Checks if the recommendations list is not null or empty.

5. **`RatingBasedRecommendationTest`**
    - Verifies fetching and sorting of high-rated movies.
    - Ensures the recommendations list is returned in descending order of rating.

6. **`RecommendationGridTest`**
    - Tests the loading and display of movie recommendations.
    - Verifies sorting functionality for release date, rating, and popularity.

## üìù Future Improvements

- **Support for TV Shows and Music Recommendations**  
  Extend the system to recommend TV shows and music based on user preferences.

- **User Profiles**  
  Implement user accounts for personalized recommendations and saved preferences.

- **Advanced Filters**  
  Add more filtering options, such as actors, directors, and specific keywords.

- **Offline Mode**  
  Allow the system to function offline by caching data locally.

- **Improved Error Handling**  
  Enhance error handling to provide more user-friendly error messages for network issues and API failures.

---

## üêû Known Issues

- **API Rate Limits:**  
  The TMDB API has a rate limit, which may cause temporary unavailability if too many requests are made in a short period.

- **Network Dependency:**  
  The application requires a stable internet connection to fetch movie data. Lack of connectivity can result in failures.

- **Slow Loading Times:**  
  Fetching large datasets or high-resolution images may result in slow loading times, especially on slower networks.
