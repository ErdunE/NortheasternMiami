#  Roadmap for Entertainment Recommendation System
***

## Completed Tasks (Mid-Semester)
* **Implemented Core Design**:
    - The Strategy Pattern is integrated into the project.
    - Basic recommendation strategies (Popular and Genre-Based) are functional.
    - JUnit tests validate the recommendation strategies.
* **Basic Recommendation Functionality**:
    - Users can get recommendations based on genre or popularity.

## Planned Tasks (Final Project)
* **Factory Design Pattern**: Implement a Factory to dynamically select strategies based on user input.
* **Additional Recommendation Strategies**: Add more recommendation algorithms (e.g., Rating-Based).
* **User Preferences**: Store and use user preferences to improve recommendations.
* **UI Implementation**: Create a user interface for interaction (using CLI or JavaFX).
* **Data Storage**: Add a persistent data store to save user preferences and media metadata.
