***
## Basic Information
* #### Author: Erdun E
* #### Course: CS5010 Program Design Paradigm
* #### Program: Mid-Semester Assignment
* #### Professor: Lindsay Jamieson

## Project Overview
#### The Entertainment Recommendation System provides personalized media recommendations movies based on user preferences(probabaly add more before the end of the semester, such as music, or TV shows). Users can switch between different recommendation strategies, such as genre-based recommendations or popular recommendations.

## Design Patterns
* **Strategy Design Pattern (Mid-Semester)**: Used to allow the system to switch between different recommendation algorithms dynamically.
* **Factory Design Pattern (Final Project)**: Will allow dynamic creation of recommendation strategies based on user input.

## Key Features
* **Partial Functionality (Mid-Semester)**: Users can select either a **Popular** or **Genre-Based** recommendation strategy.
* **Planned Features (Final Project)**: Expand recommendation algorithms, integrate user preferences, and add UI for interaction.

## Rubric (Mid-Semester)
* **Design Pattern Identified** - 15 pts: Used the **Strategy Pattern**.
* **Design Pattern Incorporated or Intention to Incorporate is Clear** - 15 pts: The Strategy Pattern is currently implemented. In final project will use the Factory Pattern.
* **Kind of Service Identified** - 15 pts: The service is an **Entertainment Recommendation System**.
* **Kind of Service at Least Partial Functionality** - 15 pts: The prototype code provided basic movie recommendations.
