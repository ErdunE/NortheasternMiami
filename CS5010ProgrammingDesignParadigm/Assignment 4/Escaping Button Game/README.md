## Escaping Button Game
### Overview
This is designed as part of Assignment 4 of CS5010, and focusing 
on subverting typical user expectations in digital interactions 
through creative design.  
The Escaping Button Game is a playful and GUI base game where users
attempt to click a button, but the button dynamically moves to a
random location.
### User Behavior Expectations
In typical digital interactions, users expect buttons in a GUI to 
remain stationary and easily clickable. Users assume that moving 
the mouse pointer over a button will not affect its position, and 
they expect an immediate response upon clicking.
### How This Design Subverts User Expectations
* Button Movement: Users expect buttons to remain stationary, but 
in this game, the button escapes when the mouse approaches, making 
it unexpectedly difficult to click. This adds an element of surprise 
and frustration.
* Click Feedback: The game tracks all missed clicks, amplifying 
the userâ€™s sense of failure while encouraging persistence.
* Fake Exit: Even when the user taps the exit button successfully, 
it doesn't exit the program as expected, a feeling as if you've 
entered a rogue website.
