    "### Performance Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "The N-Queens problem was tested using a backtracking algorithm for N=8 and N=100.\n",
    "\n",
    "For **N=8**, the algorithm was able to quickly find a solution. It examined **876 nodes** and found the first solution in approximately **0.0005 seconds**. This demonstrates that backtracking is highly effective for small board sizes because the total number of possibilities (8!) is relatively small.\n",
    "\n",
    "For **N=100**, we attempted to use the same backtracking algorithm. However, the computation did not complete even after I took a shower. This is because the backtracking algorithm has a time complexity of approximately **O(N!)**, which becomes infeasible as N grows large. For N=100, the search space is approximately 100!, making it computationally impractical.\n",

    "\n",
    "Based on our performance analysis, attempting to solve the 1,000,000 Queens problem using the same backtracking algorithm is computationally impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why 1,000,000 Queens is Infeasible:\n",
    "- With O(N!) complexity, the algorithm would need to explore approximately (1,000,000)! possible states. This number is so astronomically large that even with the fastest computers, the computation would take longer than the age of the universe. \n",
    "- If our algorithm cannot complete 100-Queens in a reasonable time (requiring interruption after 15+ minutes), scaling to 1,000,000 Queens represents an increase in complexity that is beyond current computational capabilities using backtracking. \n",
    "- While the board representation only requires O(N) space (~8MB for 1,000,000 queens), the recursive call stack and search tree would quickly exhaust available memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Alternative Approaches for Large N:\n",
    "To solve 1,000,000 Queens, we would need fundamentally different algorithms:\n",
    "- Constructive algorithms using mathematical patterns \n",
    "- Probabilistic methods like genetic algorithms \n",
    "- Specialized mathematical solutions for specific N values\n",

    "### Discussion of Heuristics\n",
    "\n",
    "The heuristics used in this solver work well for classical ciphers because they use known patterns in English text.\n",
    "- Letter Frequency Analysis\n",
    "  - English letters appear with predictable frequencies. For example, 'E' is the most common letter. By comparing decrypted text to these expected frequencies, the solver can identify correct plaintexts.\n",
    "- Common Word Detection\n",
    "  - The solver gives bonus points when it finds common English words like \"the\" and \"and\". This helps confirm that the decryption is correct.\n",
    "- Priority Search\n",
    "  - Instead of trying all 26 shifts in order (0, 1, 2...), the solver tries common shifts first (3, 13, 1). This finds the answer faster.\n",
    "- Early Stopping\n",
    "  - When the solver finds a result with high confidence, it stops searching. This saves computation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "These heuristics are effective for English text and classical ciphers. However, they have limitations:\n",
    "- They only work well for English language\n",
    "- Short texts may not have enough data for frequency analysis\n",
    "- They cannot break modern encryption methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these methods make the solver fast and accurate for breaking simple ciphers."

    "### Limitations Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The cryptographic solver has the following limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Language Assumption\n",
    "  - The heuristics are designed for English text. If the plaintext is in another language, the solver may fail.  \n",
    "- Short Ciphertexts\n",
    "  - For very short messages, letter frequencies and word detection are less reliable because there is not enough data.  \n",
    "- Modern Encryption\n",
    "  - The solver only works for simple classical ciphers (like Caesar and Substitution). It cannot break modern encryption methods such as AES or RSA, which use complex algorithms and large key spaces.  \n",
    "- Heuristic Dependence\n",
    "  - The accuracy of the solver depends on the quality of the heuristics. If the heuristics are wrong or biased, the solver may produce incorrect results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while the solver is effective for small classical ciphers, it is not suitable for large-scale or modern cryptographic systems."

    "\n",
    "- Checkers  \n",
    "  - In 2007, researchers announced that checkers had been “solved.” The Chinook program mathematically proved that with perfect play from both sides, the game ends in a draw [Schaeffer et al., 2007]. AI has completely mastered checkers.\n",
